\title{det_dmsg()
  This function generates list of differentially methylated CpG sites and the
  corresponding genes, as determined by application of methylKit functions.}
\usage{
det_dmsg(mrobj, genome_ann, threshold = 25, qvalue = 0.01, mc.cores = 1,
  destrand = FALSE, outfile1 = "methyl_dmsites.txt",
  outfile2 = "methyl_dmgenes.txt")
}
\arguments{
\item{mrobj}{A methylRaw object or a methylRawList object.}

\item{genome_ann}{Genome annotation returned by get_genome_annotation()}

\item{threshold}{Cutoff for percent methylation difference, default threshold = 25.0}

\item{qvalue}{Cutoff for q-value, default q-value = 0.01}

\item{mc.cores}{Integer denoting how many cores should be used for parallel
diffential methylation calculations}

\item{destrand}{methylKit::unite() parameter; default: FALSE.
destrand=TRUE combines CpG methylation calls from both strands.}

\item{outfile1}{File name to which diff sites are written}

\item{outfile2}{File name to which diff genes are written}
}
\value{
A Granges object that contains a list of genes that have diff methylated C sites
}
