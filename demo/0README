#RWORK 0README.  Last updated: October 27, 2017 (V. Brendel)

Analyses in this directory are based on the BWASPR package, available on github:

	https://github.com/brendelgroup/BWASPR

As documented on the github page, BWASPR processes (BWASP-generated) *.mcalls files.
Input specification is via two files: the *.dat data file, and the *.par parameter
file, which are read by the BWASPR function setup_BWASPR().

Although there are of course several ways of running R-based workflows, the data
studies in this directory were conveniently produced by Rscript.  The workflow
is represented in the file

	Rscript.BWASPR

which coulde be invoked as follows (putting output into OUT-arg1):

	Rscript --default-packages=methods,datasets,utils,grDevices,graphics,stats  Rscript.BWASPR arg1 OUT-arg1

where arg1 is the prefix of a configuration file arg1.conf.  The command will source(arg1.conf) within
Rscript.BWASPR, then run the workflow according to the specifications in arg1.conf.

For convenience and testing, use

	xcheck arg1

which will call the Rscript command and put output in a directory NEW-arg1 (and compare with an existing
output directory OUT-arg1, if it exists, a useful check on updated code).

What will be run is determined by the logicals RUNsomething in the *.conf file.  The default

	RUNload    <- FALSE

	RUNcms     <- TRUE
	RUNpwc     <- TRUE
	RUNcrl     <- TRUE

	RUNrepcms  <- TRUE
	RUNrepcrl  <- TRUE

	RUNmmp     <- TRUE
	RUNacs     <- TRUE
	RUNrnk     <- TRUE
	RUNmprr    <- TRUE

	RUNdmsg    <- TRUE
	RUNdmgdtls <- TRUE
	RUNogl     <- TRUE

	RUNsave    <- FALSE

would run all implemented analyses from scratch.  To omit certain steps (e.g., to re-run only some
io the analyses with changed parameters), change TRUE to FALSE.  RUNload=TRUE will load a previously
saved arg1.RData file into the R workspace before executing other analyses steps.  To generate an
arg1.RData file from the current run, set RUNsave=TRUE.

To check the mechanics of running BWASPR, you can use the small data set in ../inst/exdata.  Run

	xdoit sample OUT-sample

and take a look at the 0README files in the output directory and its subdirectories.
